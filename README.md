# Okay, But How Do You Feel?

Exploring SpriteKit + catharsis

## Oh.

I've had this idea mulling around in my head. If [We Feel Fine](http://www.wefeelfine.org/) was still a thing, I'd like to integrated different moods with different particle effects. But it's not, so I'll slot in my own mood.

## Yeah.

I've never touched SpriteKit before today. There are some (probably) very undesirable (read: inefficient) strategies for rendering happening, so don't use this as a reference on efficiency. But it does the job.

## What Job?
